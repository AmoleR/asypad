# AsyPad

AsyPad is WYSIWYG drawing tool that can convert your diagrams into Asymptote seamlessly.

## Development

You need `Node.JS` (along with at least one of `npm` or `yarn` installed); feel free to use the `node:alpine` Docker image. You can start up development using `yarn start` (or `npm start`), and view a production build using `yarn build && npx serve -s build` (or `npm run build && npx serve -s build`).
